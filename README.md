__From SMACSS:__

At the very core of SMACSS is categorization. By categorizing CSS rules, we begin to see patterns and can define better practices around each of these patterns.

There are five types of categories:

- Base
- Layout
- Module
- State
- Theme

We often find ourselves mixing styles across each of these categories. If we are more aware of what we are trying to style, we can avoid the complexity that comes from intertwining these rules.

Each category has certain guidelines that apply to it. This somewhat succinct separation allows us to ask ourselves questions during the development process. How are we going to code things and why are we going to code them that way?

Much of the purpose of categorizing things is to codify patternsâ€”things that repeat themselves within our design. Repetition results in less code, easier maintenance, and greater consistency in the user experience. These are all wins. Exceptions to the rule can be advantageous but they should be justified.

###Base rules 
Base rules are the defaults. They are almost exclusively single element selectors but it could include attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors, child selectors or sibling selectors. Essentially, a base style says that wherever this element is on the page, it should look like this.

Examples of Base Styles
```
html, body, form { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
input[type=text] { border: 1px solid #999; }
a { color: #039; }
a:hover { color: #03C; }
```

###Layout rules 
Layout rules divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or more modules together.

###Modules 
Modules are the reusable, modular parts of our design. They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on.

###State rules 
State rules are ways to describe how our modules or layouts will look when in a particular state. Is it hidden or expanded? Is it active or inactive? They are about describing how a module or layout looks on screens that are smaller or bigger. They are also about describing how a module might look in different views like the home page or the inside page.


###External
Added 'External' folder for any third-party styles, in this case, Bootstrap.
